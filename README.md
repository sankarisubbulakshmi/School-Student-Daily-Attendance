# School Student Daily Attendance Dataset
## Overview
The School Student Daily Attendance dataset provides daily attendance records for students across different schools. It is useful for analyzing attendance patterns, identifying trends, and improving school management strategies.

## Data Description
The dataset contains the following columns:

1. School DBN: The District Borough Number (DBN) identifying the school.
2. Date: The date of the attendance record (in YYYYMMDD format).
3. Enrolled: The number of students enrolled on that date.
4. Absent: The number of students absent on that date.
5. Present: The number of students present on that date.
6. Released: The number of students released early (if applicable).

## Learning outcomes
The School Student Daily Attendance dataset is primarily used for supervised learning. This is because the dataset includes 
structured data with labeled information about student attendance (e.g., enrolled, absent, present, released), which can be used to train models for predictive 
tasks such as forecasting attendance trends or identifying factors affecting student absences.

Supervised Learning Use Cases:
Predictive Modeling: Predicting future attendance patterns based on historical data.
Classification: Classifying days as high or low attendance based on various factors.
Unsupervised Learning Use Cases:
Clustering: Grouping days or schools with similar attendance patterns to identify trends.
Anomaly Detection: Identifying unusual attendance patterns or anomalies in the data.
Overall, the primary focus with this dataset is likely on supervised learning, given the specific, labeled nature of the data.
